This repository aims to provide a comprehensive set of C programs using data structures that can be used for learning and reference purposes. This is my journey as a beginner in data structures, you'll find useful examples and code snippets to enhance your understanding of Java.

## Programs

1. [Linear Search with space complexity and time complexity](linearSearch.c)
2. [Binary Search with space complexity and time complexity](binarySearch.c)
3. [Insertion sort with space complexity and time complexity](InsertionSort.c)
4. [Selection sort with space complexity and time complexity](SelectionSort.c)
